I'm a computer scientist at Dublin City University, ADAPT Research Centre, and University of Aberdeen. 
I work in the NLG research group in DCU/ADAPT, and the CLAN research group at Aberdeen. 
My main research interests are natural language generation, evaluation of NLP systems, reproducibility, and ethical AI.
